## 4.1 Learning Outcome

In this hands-on exercise, we will gain hands-on experience on using:

-   ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information,

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics, and

-   parameters package to visualise model parameters

## 4.2 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot

ggstatsplot is an extension of ggplot2 package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves. - To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default. - To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the APA gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test:

## 4.3 Getting started

### 4.3.1 Installing and launching R packages

In this exercise, ggstatsplot and tidyverse will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

### 4.3.2 Importing data

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### 4.3.3 One-sample test: gghistostats() method

In the code chunk below, gghistostats() is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```

## 4.3.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor

- A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

- That's because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

- When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

- The Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```
