In this section, we will use a ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork.\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np12 <- p1|p2\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements. If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page. By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7. By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n3.4.3 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css <- \"background-color:white; #<<\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #<<\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #<<\n    opts_tooltip(    #<<\n      css = tooltip_css)) #<<\n)                                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean.

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, we will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, we can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning."

    "text": "4.3.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor\n\nA Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)"
