<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="task-overview">1. Task Overview</h2>
<p>Seafood is the largest traded food commodity, providing sustenance to more than 3 billion people worldwide. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that 85% of fish stocks are either overfished or fully exploited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a major contributor to overfishing worldwide. According to a study conducted by the Financial Transparency Coalition, it found that IUU fishing accounts for one-fifth of the global fisheries’ catches (equivalent to approximately $23.5bn) annually. Global losses arising from IUU fishing are also estimated to be approximately $50bn (Collyns, 2022).</p>
<p>Therefore, as part of Mini-Challenge 2 of VAST Challenge 2023, NGO FishEye International (a nonpartisan organization) is charged with understanding the social, political, and economic forces that drive the illegal fishing trade and I am addressing question 4 of MC Challenge 2. I first begin by outlining the series of steps I took to eventually arrive at my response titled “Mini-Case 2 Challenge Writeup &amp; 4 Images” within Section 7 below.</p>

<p>The dataset utilised for the below analysis consists of a total of 34,552 nodes and 5,464,092 direct edges (shipper to receiver). It is a directed multi-graph, hence multiple edges between the same two nodes are possible. The full details can be found on: https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/MC2.html</p>

<p>We begin by initialising the nodes and edges based off the dataset “MC2_challenge_graph” - MC2_nodes consists of id, shpcountry and rcvcountry - MC2_edges consists of source, target, arrivaldate, hscode, valueofgoods_omu, volumeteu, weightkg and valueofgoodsusd.</p>
<p>We utilised the mutate function to derive a new variable called “year” from “arrivaldate”. Additionally, we ensured that all MC2_edges records are distinct with no duplicates via the distinct() function.</p>

<p>From the below chart, we can see the top 30 hscode within MC2_edges. Upon further investigation, it seems that HS Codes starting with 1604 and 1605 are relevant for our analysis. 1604 refers to “prepared or preserved fish, fish eggs, caviar”, while 1605 refers to Crustaceans, molluscs, etc, prepared or preserved”</p>

<p>To ensure a more effective analysis, we tidied up MC2_edges to only contain hscode that begins with 301 to 308 or 1604 and 1605 to scope MC2_edges towards fish related products. However, as seen from the below output, it seems like there are not sufficient information within the description columns to inform us of the specific product tied to the hscode.</p>

<p>Therefore, we created a new column to store the hscode_parent where it will contain only the first three digit of the hscode. With this, we then map the description from Connect2India Harmonized System Code to gleam further insights into the worded description.</p>

<p>As seen from the results above, there are NA records. Therefore, we performed cleaning on the MC2_nodes to remove shpcountry that has na records or rcvcountry that has na records. Additionally, we also removed duplicated IDs within MC2_nodes. The cleaned data is then stored in MC2_nodes_cleaned.</p>

<p>Next, we want to determine what are the NA records within MC2_edges, and the extent of missing records within each columns. We can see that valueofgoods_omu has a total of 99.97% missing records, followed by valueofgoodsusd with 3.10% and volumeteu with 0.19%. We also note that hscode_des has 100% missing records as the specific hscodes are not found in Connect2India Harmonized System Code records.</p>
<p>Despite the below results, we will continue to keep the records at this stage, as we are looking to derive a new column called “weight” in the subsequent stage.</p>

<p>We begin our overall exploratory data analysis by understanding the volume of fishing shipments in terms of weight (kg) over the years. We utilise ggplot to plot a bar chart over by weight-kg (y-axis) over the years (x-axis). We also utilised scale_y_continuous to format the labels to “billions”. Additionally, scale_x_discrete was used to enable the x-axis to be unique values of the year variable from MC2_edges dataframe.</p>
<p>As seen from the plot below, we can see an overall increasing trend in terms of shipment volume. This makes managing IUU fishing even more pressing and urgent.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="top-8-sources-across-the-years-by-varying-metrics">4.5 Top 8 Sources across the Years by varying metrics</h3>
<p>Within this section, we take a look a the top 8 sources across the years by weightkg and value of goods usd. We looped over the years to calculate the top 8 sources by the relevant metrics for each year, before leveraging on plot_ly() to create a line chart to visualise the trends over the years.</p>

<p>Within this section, we take a look a the top 8 targets across the years by weightkg and value of goods usd. We looped over the years to calculate the top 8 targets by the relevant metrics for each year, before leveraging on plot_ly() to create a line chart to visualise the trends over the years.</p>

<p>With the above Exploratory Data Analysis setting a good foundation for further visualisation on the network graph, we first begin by preparing the edges and nodes properly per code chunks below:</p>
<p>The below code chunk creates a new MC2_edges_cleaned factoring in the below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>creation of new column called weight that counts the number of times the source and target connects in a year</p></li>
<li><p>creation of new column called noofunique_targets that counts the number of unique source target relationship</p></li>
<li><p>filter away records where source is not equal to target</p></li>
<li><p>select all records where weights existing in the top 95 percentile</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communitycluster-detection">5. Community/Cluster Detection</h2>
<p>In the section below, we plot a basic static graph to gain an overall view of the node edge connection to better understand and detect communities/clusters. “fr” (Fruchterman-Reingold) layout was utilised as it is a special force directed layout where nodes are drawn closer to nodes they are connected to. A total of three methods were explored, namely: infomap clustering, leading eigen clustering and group components.</p>
<p>The below shows the code for plotting a infomap cluster which is suitable for both directed and undirected graph.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-degree-centrality-by-years">6.1 In-Degree Centrality by Years</h2>
<p>Within this section, we will leverage on degree centrality and ggraph to plot a static network graph. Indegree centrality is defined in the below code via mode = “in”. Note that the dataset is furthered focused into a smaller subset in the below section as we are filtering for weights which are &gt;= quantile 0.8.</p>
<p>Within the code outlined in Code Chunk below, we have also defined a node to be a “Central Carrier” if it’s above a threshold currently defined at 2. If otherwise, then the node will be defined as “Fishing Vessel”. This value was arrived after a few trial and errors before deciding that this was an optimal value. This helps us to detect transshipments which are frequent perpetrators of IUU fishing occuring out at sea.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="out-degree-centrality-by-years">6.2 Out-Degree Centrality by Years</h2>
<p>Within this section, we will leverage on degree centrality and ggraph to plot a static network graph. Out degree centrality is defined in the below code via mode = “out”. Note that the dataset is furthered focused into a smaller subset in the below section as we are filtering for weights which are &gt;= quantile 0.8.</p>
<p>Within the code outlined in Code Chunk below, we have also defined a node to be a “Central Carrier” if it’s above a threshold currently defined at 2. If otherwise, then the node will be defined as “Fishing Vessel”. This value was arrived after a few trial and errors before deciding that this was an optimal value. This helps us to detect transshipments which are frequent perpetrators of IUU fishing occuring out at sea.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mini-case-2-challenge-writeup-4-images">Mini-Case 2 Challenge Writeup &amp; 4 Images</h2>
<p>For the purpose of mini-case 2 challenge writeup question 4, it is as per below bullet points. The supporting images are found in section 7.1 - 7.4.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>IUU fishing occurrences typically occurs in the high seas. Given that transshipments are a huge potential for IUU fishing trades to occur as fishing vessels can obscure the origins of their catches that might have been caught illegally. The focus of this visualisation targets the transshipments between central carriers and fishing vessels. The visualisation outlined Section 7 serves to put forth the basis to enable the identification of companies that fit patterns of illegal fishing.</p></li>
<li><p>Leveraging on Section 7.2 Interactive Visual, “Turkish Mussels LLC and” company is one example of a company that fit a pattern of illegal fishing. It was active in 2028 with several in-degree associations with three main nodes: 1) Arena del Sol Pic, 2) Mar del Placer CJSC Transport and 3) Saltwater Sirens Limited Liability Company Marine conservation. However, “Turkish Mussels LLC and” company seems to have closed down thereafter. It appears that these three nodes are going to “Turkish Mussels LLC and” to obtain illegal catches. Arena del Sol Pic has a high outdegree centrality as it goes out to several nodes such as “Saltwater Supreme OAO Forwarding” and “Selous Game Reserve S.A. de C.V” during 2029 for example to get fish supplies. Notably, Arena del Sol Pic is still in the business even in 2034, reaching out to nodes such as “Mar del Este CJSC” which has a high indegree centrality. This seems to imply that Arena del Sol Pic is the end user of the fishing product it gets from its supplier (ie implying that it brings the fishes directly out to the market for sale).</p></li>

<p>It appears that the top 3 clusters (in descending order, Cluster 20, 1, 23) consists of 14.8%, 14.3% and 9.2% of the framed dataset. This seems to suggest a presence of three bigger communities/clusters.</p>

<p>Here, we explore the In-Degree Centrality network graph in an interactive manner across the various years. The below code chunk shows a sample of how we can plot an interactive network graph leveraging on the computed in-degree centrality over the years. We first begin by converting the graph into a tibble the interactive network graph requires us to work with numerical identifiers before defining the dropdown option via VisOptions.</p>

<p>Here, we explore the Eigenvector Centrality network graph in an interactive manner across the various years. The below code chunk shows a sample of how we can plot an interactive network graph leveraging on the computed eigenvector centrality over the years. We first begin by converting the graph into a tibble the interactive network graph requires us to work with numerical identifiers before defining the dropdown option via VisOptions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections">8. Reflections</h2>
<p>The most difficult aspect of working with this graph is in relation to the steep learning curve and computing resources. Personally, I do not have much exposure into coding with R, and hence this was a huge challenge for me as I faced repeated roadblocks when coding or data wrangling despite several research online. Additionally, my computer’s computing resources was rather limited, and I also had to spend a lot of wait time to enable it to run the codes without my computer hanging.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Professor Kam extended the submission due date and he was always readily available and willing to share his time to help get me up to speed. Professor Kam also helped me and the class to get up to speed by explaining data wrangling concepts very clearly, and I truly benefitted from it.</p>
<p>I learnt a lot from this take-home exercise but I’m sure there is more to learn as knowledge graph always reveals new insights and patterns for individuals to perform analysis on.</p>
